O2GMarketDataSnapshotResponseReader doesn't have instrument property - requires additional structure to hold RequestID and associated Instrument to obtain that info.

Some calls require passing O2GAccountRow, which in turn require us to keep that object associated with our AccountRow. It's very unlikely that the
entire structure is necessary to make those calls.

O2G objects are readonly, and do not expose/implement "readonly" interfaces that would allow for unit tests where
those objects could be faked, thus breaking reliance on the backend system.
